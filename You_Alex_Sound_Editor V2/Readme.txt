No addition from the demo.
the DFT and Convolve and IDFT buttons become unclickable once they clicked

To draw graph after from recorded samples, press draw button on the main form.
Opening file automatically draws graph

IDFT revereses DFT so it generates selected samples from time domain graph from
the Frequency domaing graph.(Checkings that DFT works fine)

Convolve button applies filtering to the whole samples in Time domain graph
